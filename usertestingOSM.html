                    <p class="mb-30"> Online Supermarket (OSM) is a new online grocery shopping service specializing in South Asian products. OSM operates from Squamish and delivers across the Lower Mainland.
                      The goal of the study was to discover potential customers’ perceptions about the OSM website (www.onlinesupermarket.ca). It also evaluated the website’s effectiveness for the process of finding, browsing, and selecting grocery items. Since the website is still in its early stages, a more exploratory approach with emphasis on qualitative findings was chosen for this study.
                      It was a semester long project for an upper division subject and we ultimately handed OSM a link to the final

                      </p>
                    <h5>Method</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30"> The study examined potential users of OSM, focusing on males and females aged 20-30. Since many members of this age group are comfortable with online shopping, they may be more likely to order groceries from online stores such as OSM. The study was conducted using four different methods: an online survey, a card sorting activity, usability tests, and a post-test questionnaire.
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Online Survey</li>
                        <p>An online questionnaire, created through Google Forms, was completed by eleven potential users of OSM. The survey studied people’s demographics, online shopping habits, and their experiences/comfort levels with buying groceries online. 

                          <br><b><u>Data Collection</u></b><br>Open and close-ended questions were used to collect a mix of quantitative and qualitative data.
                          
                          <br><b><u>Purpose</u></b><br>
                          Understanding people’s past experiences and perceptions can provide context for the data collected in future methods, and how they may affect users’ experiences with OSM.
                          </p>

                          <li>Card Sorting</li>
                          <p>On Figma, six types of information found in online shopping websites were placed on individual cards: deals/promos, prices, products, customer testimonials, and value proposition. Using Zoom’s screen share function, researchers shared these cards with five participants individually, and re-ordered them based on which information the participant would look for         
                            <br><b><u>Data Collection</u></b><br>
                            Results were collected directly from the cards on Figma.
                            
                            <br><b><u>Purpose</u></b><br>
                            Data from card sorting can be used to improve the information architecture of the OSM website.

                            <li>Usability Testing</li>
                            <p>Six one-on-one usability tests were conducted on Zoom. Participants (new users of OSM) began with an open exploration of the site while sharing their screen and discussing first impressions.
                              In the next step, participants were tasked to find items from a shopping list provided by the researchers, and add them to their cart. Participants were asked to select items they would consider choosing in real life, in order to simulate a real scenario. They were also asked  to verbalize their thoughts while completing the task.
                              <br><b><u>Data Collection</u></b><br>
                              Qualitative data was collected using think aloud methods, which were aided by probing questions. Notes, as well as screen recordings of the sessions, were used to capture data.
                              <br><b><u>Purpose</u></b><br>
                              The usability test examined a potential customer’s journey through the process of browsing products, which is a key task involved in grocery shopping. It helped identify specific pain points of the UI as well as any missing information or features that would help complete this task.

                                The post-test questionnaire was created on Google Forms and distributed to the six participants from the usability study. The questionnaire gathered participants’ reflections from the user study by asking specific questions about their overall impressions, what they enjoyed/struggled with, and their opinions on specific UI elements such as images and links.
                                <br><b><u>Data Collection</u></b><br>

                                The post-test questionnaire allowed participants to reflect and share their experiences with the OSM website outside the presence of the researchers.

                      <h5>Data Analysis</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30"> Quantitative data was analyzed through frequency distribution. Meanwhile, qualitative responses were examined by identifying frequently-occuring responses and finding themes.
                      Card sorting results were evaluated in terms of frequency. Researchers counted the number of times each item was ranked within a participant’s top three in order to find the top categories.

                      <h5>Validity</h5>
                      <p class="mb-30"> To help ensure internal validity, researchers aimed to minimize study fatigue by keeping the sessions and questionnaires brief, and keeping the tasks simple. In the analysis phase, data was also coded and examined by three different researchers in order to reduce bias.
                        However, external validity can be improved. Due to limited access to participants and scheduling conflicts, data collection was restricted to a narrower population. While they represent a key demographic for OSM, other user groups need to be considered to improve generalizability.                        
                        </p>
